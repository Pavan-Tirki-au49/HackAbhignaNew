# CRITICAL FIX: Directly specifying the absolute paths using the correct folder name.

# NOTE: You MUST replace the text 'Waste_Detection.v1.yolov8n' below 
# with the ACTUAL name of the folder found inside C:\...\circuscan_app\runs\detect\

# The path to your validation images folder (must be the real path on your machine)
val: C:/Users/pavan/OneDrive/Desktop/circuscan_app/runs/detect/val/valid/images 

# The path to your training images folder (must be the real path on your machine)
train: C:/Users/pavan/OneDrive/Desktop/circuscan_app/runs/detect/val/train/images 

# The path to your testing images folder (must be the real path on your machine)
test: C:/Users/pavan/OneDrive/Desktop/circuscan_app/runs/detect/val/test/images
